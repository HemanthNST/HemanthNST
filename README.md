Hey there! 👋🏼
I'm Hemanth Tenneti, an enthusiast in design and intermediate programmer here to find ways to improve. Here's some things about me,

📑 I'm currently in under-graduate Computer Science major at Rishihood University, Sonipat.
✨ Exploring ways to widen my knowledge and creative abilities.
⚙️ Python, & JS are languages I am comfortable with.
🪛 I also dabble in website making with HTML, & CSS.
Fun fact, my interest in programming has stemmed from me wanting to create moderation bots for the chatapp, Discord. It has widened since with me wanting to further my knowledge due to my high-school projects. You can find some of these projects listed on my GitHub. And my enthusiasm in designing followed suit my interest in using Figma.
